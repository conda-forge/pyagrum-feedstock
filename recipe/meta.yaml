  summary: pyAgrum is a scientific C++ and Python library dedicated to Bayesian Networks and other Probabilistic Graphical Models.
  description: |
    aGrUM is a C++ library for graphical models. It is designed for easily building applications
    using graphical models such as Bayesian networks, influence diagrams, decision trees, GAI networks
    or Markov decision processes. pyAgrum provides a high-level interface to the part of aGrUM allowing
    to create, model, learn, use, calculate with and embed Bayesian Networks and other graphical models.
    Some specific (python and C++) codes are added in order to simplify and extend the aGrUM API.
